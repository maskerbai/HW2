		<h2>Jintan’s story</h2>
			<p>I come from China. My hometown is a little city in Middle area in China. I have a happy family, my mother, father and little sister. My hometown to China is like Iowa to the United States. After I graduated from Senior High School in my hometown, I started to study overseas. At that time, it is totally my family’s will to let me study aboard. I have no clue what I am going to meet and what would happen to me in the future. However, after four meaningful years of college life in United States, I feel lucky I made that wise choice four years ago.</p>
			<p>When I attended to the first lecture in the University of Iowa, I can barely understand anything that professor said. It was totally nightmare for me. I thought it was an awful decision to study aboard. However, I did not stop and give up. I watched Friends during after-class period and paid full attention on the lecture. At the end of first semester, I could understand eighty percent of the lecture. </p>
			<p>Another big problem for me is to understand the American culture. In China, we don’t have the social form called “party” like American do. I prefer to hang out with my close friend and talked about recent lives. This kind of lifestyle is more attractive to me. </p>
			<p>Anyway, it is fine to study overseas. Though I have lots of things to complain, the some restaurants in Iowa City are pretty nice. I enjoy the global good cultures here. I listed a couple of good Asian restaurants here. Hope someone interested in food can have a taste some time. </p>

		<h2>Jintan’s Favorite Dining Place in Iowa City</h2>
			<h3>Sushi Buffet</h3> 
				<p>Recommendation 4.5 stars</p>
				<p>Satisfy your stomach with cheap price. There are lots of seafood specials on Sunday. Some Chinese traditional dishes are good for me. However, the sushi is so-so, and the dining environment is also not good. </p> 

			<h3>Mekong</h3> 
				<p>Recommendation 4 stars</p>
				<p>A Vietnam Restaurant with Median price with decent dining environment; a good place for a date or a couple. Beef noodles are highly recommend there. However, the dishes are too American style. </p>

			<h3>Kapok Restaurant</h3>
				<p>Recommendation 4 stars</p>
				<p>Taste No.1 Chinese Restaurant with decent dining environment. It cooks the real Chinese food. Some food is a little bit spicy for Americans. However, the location is too far away. </p>
